# Python UI Example

This script is a simple working example of 2 libraries:

* [Bullet](https://github.com/Mckinsey666/bullet/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) 
* [Progress](https://github.com/verigak/progress/) 

There are 2 functions to demonstrate each library in a hypothetical use case.

## getUserInput()

This function just gets a user choice from a list of possible values. This function returns the integer value of the user choice and passes it on to `progressBar()`

## progressBar()

This takes the named parameter `length` to set the max value for the progress bar. This value is used to work out the progress in relation to the current interation.
